A foundational reformulation of physics based on contrast fields, perceptual thresholds, and resolution-sensitive topology.

# Contrast-Induced Topology: A Structural Framework for Emergence and Identity

This repository hosts the foundational materials for the theory of contrast-based structural emergence, developed by AndrÃ© Hampshire. It offers a rigorous and novel reformulation of physical appearance, topology, and identity grounded in the modulation of contrast fields and perceptual thresholds.

## ðŸ“˜ Summary

In this framework, space, time, particles, and waves are not taken as ontological primitives. Instead, they emerge from thresholded structural features in a contrast field \( C(x, t) \). Observable structure is modeled through Betti numbers, perceptual criteria for temporal framing, and a contrast-based Lagrangian field theory.

This repository includes:
- Manuscript PDF and source
- Simulations and visualizations
- Topological field derivations
